[Bitwise Operator]
AND  & : both are 1 == 1 else 0
OR   | : both are 0 == 0 else 1
XOR  ^ : two bit number is different == 1
NOT  ~ : ~A = -A - 1

[Bit Shifts]
LEFT SHIFT   << : A << a means moving bit num A to the left a times
RIGHT SHIFT  >> : A >> a means moving bit num A to the right a times
** zeros are shifted in to replace the discarded bits.
** the bits that are shifted out are discarded

[Conditional Expression]
the only result is true and false

==     : same
!=     : not same
>, <   : big, small
>=, <= : big or same, small or same

A&&B : both A and B is true -> true, else false
A||B : more than one of A and B is true -> true, else false
!A   : if A is false -> true, true -> false

[Ternary Operator]
Condition ? (return when true) : (return when false)
